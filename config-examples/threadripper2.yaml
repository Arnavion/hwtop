# Sensors are read using the hwmon sysfs interface. Every hwmon device has a corresponding device name.
# So define some hwmon devices corresponding to the device names.
#
# Each entry here corresponds to a path under `/sys/class/hwmon`. The `dev_name` is the value of `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/name`
hwmon:
  # Define an hwmon named "cpu1" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "k10temp"
  cpu1:
    dev_name: 'k10temp'

  # Define an hwmon named "cpu2" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "k10temp".
  # There are two such devices because this is a Threadripper CPU, so there's one for each core.
  #
  # Even though this has the same device name as the previous "cpu1" hwmon, `hwtop` will ensure it doesn't
  # map both hwmons to the same device.

# List of sensor groups. Each group has a name, zero or more temp sensors, and zero or more fan sensors, and is rendered on one line.

# Sensor groups allow you to group sensors from multiple hwmon devices into one logical group.

  temps:
    # This is a temp sensor under the hwmon named "cpu1" and is temp sensor number 1 in that device.
    # For example, if that device had the path `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1`, then this sensor's value is read from
    # `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1/temp1_input`
    #
    # Sensors are automatically named after the corresponding label file in the hwmon device, if available
    # (eg `temp1_label` for temp sensor number 1, or `fan2_label` for fan sensor number 2).
    # This name can be overriden by setting the `name` property of the sensor.
    # Here, the `name` property is set on these sensors because the hwmon driver doesn't have labels for them.
