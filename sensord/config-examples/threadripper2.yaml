# This example config is for a desktop computer.

# Sensors are read using the hwmon sysfs interface. Every hwmon device has a corresponding device name.
# So define some hwmon devices corresponding to the device names.
#
# Each entry here corresponds to a path under `/sys/class/hwmon`. The `dev_name` is the value of `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/name`
hwmon:
  # Define an hwmon named "cpu1" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "k10temp"
  cpu1:
    dev_name: 'k10temp'

  # Define an hwmon named "cpu2" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "k10temp".
  # There are two such devices because this is a Threadripper CPU, so there's one for each core.
  #
  # Even though this has the same device name as the previous "cpu1" hwmon, `hwtop` will ensure it doesn't
  # map both hwmons to the same device.
  cpu2:
    dev_name: 'k10temp'

  # Define an hwmon named "gpu" for the device named "amdgpu"
  gpu:
    dev_name: 'amdgpu'

  # Define an hwmon named "mobo" for the device named "nct6779"
  mobo:
    dev_name: 'nct6779'

# List of sensor groups. Each group has a name, zero or more temp sensors, and zero or more fan sensors.
#
# Sensor groups allow you to group sensors from multiple hwmon devices into one logical group.
sensors:
  # The first group is for the CPU. It includes the CPU's own temp sensors, the motherboard's temp sensor for the CPU,
  # and the motherboard's fan sensor for the CPU fan.
- name: 'CPU'
  temps:
    # Sensors are identified in two ways, either by their number or by their label. For example, temp sensor 1
    # has its value in the file `temp1_input` and its label in the file `temp1_label`. Identifying a sensor by its label
    # is handy in order to have a self-documenting string, but note that not all sensors have labels.
    #
    # sensord also considers sensors to have a name. One can be specified explicitly in the config,
    # or else the label will be used as the name.
    #
    # These two temp sensors are looked up under the hwmons named "cpu1" and "cpu2" respectively by their label "Tdie".
    # For example, if that device had the path `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1`, and if `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1/temp2_label` has the contents "Tdie",
    # then this sensor's value would be read from `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1/temp2_input`
    #
    # Since both sensors have the same label, their default name would also be the same. So here their `name` property is set explicitly
    # to visually differentiate between them.
  - hwmon: 'cpu1'
    label: 'Tdie'
    name: 'CPU 1'
  - hwmon: 'cpu2'
    label: 'Tdie'
    name: 'CPU 2'
    # This is a temp sensor under the hwmon named "mobo" and is temp sensor number 7 in that device.
    # For example, if that device had the path `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0`, then this sensor's value is read from
    # `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp7_input`. Furthermore, a static offset of -27.0 is applied to this sensor's value
    # before it's displayed (because this is a Threadripper 2 CPU).
  - hwmon: 'mobo'
    label: 'SMBUSMASTER 0'
    offset: -27.0
  fans:
    # This is a fan sensor under the hwmon named "mobo" and is fan sensor number 2 in that device.
    # Just like with temp sensors the sensor can be looked up by label instead, and the sensor name has the same behavior as for temp sensors.
    # Since the fan sensor does not have a corresponding label, it is looked up by number.
    #
    # For example, if that device had the path `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0`, then this sensor's value is read from
    # `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/fan2_input`
  - hwmon: 'mobo'
    num: 2
    name: 'Fan 1'

  # The second sensor group is also for the CPU. This group is for the Tccd1 sensor, reported as temp sensor number 3.
  # Unfortunately the sensor is only reported by only one of the k10temp hwmon devices, and it's not possible to know up-front
  # which device it will be reported by. So this section simply defines the sensor to be read from both devices.
  # At runtime, the one that exists will be read successfully, and the one that doesn't will just be ignored.
- name: 'CPU'
  temps:
  - hwmon: 'cpu1'
