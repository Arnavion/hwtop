# This example config is for a Thinkpad T61 laptop.

# Sensors are read using the hwmon sysfs interface. Every hwmon device has a corresponding device name.
# So define some hwmon devices corresponding to the device names.
#
# Each entry here corresponds to a path under `/sys/class/hwmon`. The `dev_name` is the value of `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/name`
hwmon:
  # Define an hwmon named "acpi" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "acpitz"
  acpi:
    dev_name: 'acpitz'

  # Define an hwmon named "cpu" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "coretemp"
  cpu:
    dev_name: 'coretemp'

  # Define an hwmon named "gpu" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "nouevau"
  gpu:
    dev_name: 'nouveau'

  # Define an hwmon named "mobo" corresponding to the real hwmon device with name "thinkpad"
  mobo:
    dev_name: 'thinkpad'


# List of sensor groups. Each group has a name, zero or more temp sensors, and zero or more fan sensors, and is rendered on one line.
#
# Sensor groups allow you to group sensors from multiple hwmon devices into one logical group.
sensors:
  # The first group is for the CPU. It includes the CPU's own temp sensors and the motherboard's temp sensor for the CPU.
- name: 'CPU'
  temps:
    # This is a temp sensor under the hwmon named "cpu" and is temp sensor number 2 in that device.
    # For example, if that device had the path `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1`, then this sensor's value is read from
    # `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1/temp2_input`

    # Sensors are automatically named after the corresponding label file in the hwmon device, if available
    # (eg `temp1_label` for temp sensor number 1, or `fan2_label` for fan sensor number 2).
    # This name can be overriden by setting the `name` property of the sensor.
    # Here, the `name` property is set on this motherboard temp sensor to identify that it's coming from the motherboard.
