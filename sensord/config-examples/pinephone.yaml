# This example config is for a PinePhone.

cpus:
  # CPU frequency is normally read from `/proc/cpuinfo`. However the PinePhone's kernel does not populate the CPU frequency in that file.
  # Setting `use_sysfs` to `true` makes `hwtop` read the CPU frequency from `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq` instead.
  #
  # While the `scaling_cur_freq` file is always present, it is better to let `hwtop` read from `/proc/cpuinfo` if the frequency information is available there.
  # This is because each read of an individual `scaling_cur_freq` file can block for 10ms, which can add up to a noticeable delay for machines with many CPUs.
  # Reading from `/proc/cpuinfo` also has this delay, but it only applies once to the whole file regardless of how many CPUs there are.
  #
  # Thus `use_sysfs` should be set to `true` only if the default of `false` does not work.

# Sensors are read using the hwmon sysfs interface. Every hwmon device has a corresponding device name.
# So define some hwmon devices corresponding to the device names.

# Each entry here corresponds to a path under `/sys/class/hwmon`. The `dev_name` is the value of `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/name`
